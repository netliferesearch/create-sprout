# TODO

These strings need to be set through the CLI, with gracious fallbacks

```
<% replace with gatsby active environment %> | develop
<% replace with owners name %> | Client Inc.
<% replace with project description %> | Client Inc. is blah blah
<% replace with project name %> | The Project Name
<% replace with project name kebab-case %> | the-project-name
<% replace with project repo base url %> | user/the-project-name
<% replace with project repo full url %> | https://github.com/user/the-project-name
<% replace with sanity token %> | a lengthy hash string that allows making requests to Sanity Studio through the frontend
<% replace with sanity project id %> | a short hash string that connects the local Sanity Studio to the remote one
<% replace with sanity current dataset %> | production
<% replace with site url %> | https://the-project-name.com
```
